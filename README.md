# Autodeploy Action

This is a GitHub action that allows you to automatically deploy new packages from a source repo to various dependent repos.

A concrete example would be you have 30 [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) sites that rely on a custom theme. When that custom theme pushes a new stable release to `npm` it also automatically opens a pull request on all 30 sites with the updated `npm` pacakge.

In this way it is _sorta_ like `dependapot` except that the source repo **pushes** updates to its dependents as opposed to the dependent periodically looking for upstream updates.

It currently comes with the following caveats:

#### Caveats

* Only works with `yarn` and `npm` as package managers (would love to add support for `composer`, `pip` etc)
* Only works with `npm`, `yarn` and `github` as "upstream" registries
* Only works `GitHub` repo to `GitHub` repo
* User is responsible for installing any underlying deps (eg `node` and `yarn`) required by this action

## Required Inputs

These keys must be set correctly for the action to work.

| Name | Description | Example Value |
|---|---|---|
| `slug` | The GitHub repo slug you want to deploy the update package to.  | `lando/php` |

## Optional Inputs

These keys are set to sane defaults but can be modified as needed.

| Name | Description | Default | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `args` | Extra options to pass into the manager update command. | "" | `--dev` |
| `branch` | The branch to deploy the updated package to. | Automatically created. If `pr` is `false` then the Default branch for `slug`. | `master` |
| `manager` | The package manager to use for updating. | `yarn` | `yarn` \| `npm` |
| `package` | The name of the package to update. | Set based on `registry` | `@lando/php` |
| `pr` | Open a pull request with the change. | `true` | `false` |
| `pr-base` | The base branch to open the PR against. | `main` | `master` |
| `registry` | The place we should get the updated package from. | `npm` | `yarn` \| `npm` \| `github` |
| `separator` | The character that separates the `package` and `version` in the package manager update command  | Set based on `registry` | `@` |
| `token` | [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) with permission to `read/write` to target `slug` | `${{ github.token }}`. | `MYTOKEN` |
| `version` | The version of the package to update to. | Set based on `registry` | `1.3.2` |

## Testing Inputs

These keys are usually not needed but can be useful for testing.

| Name | Description | Default | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `deploy` | Toggle to disable deployment. Will `--dry-run` the `git push`. | `true` | `false` |
| `update` | Toggle to disable updating. | `true` | `false` |

## Outputs

These outputs are mostly used internally but are nonetheless available.

```yaml
outputs:
  branch:
    description: "The branch to deploy to."
    value: ${{ steps.auto-deploy-action.outputs.branch }}
  package:
    description: "The package name from user or manifest file to auto deploy."
    value: ${{ steps.auto-deploy-action.outputs.package }}
  version:
    description: "The package version from user or manifest file to auto deploy."
    value: ${{ steps.auto-deploy-action.outputs.version }}
  separator:
    description: "The separator between package and version"
    value: ${{ steps.auto-deploy-action.outputs.separator }}
```
